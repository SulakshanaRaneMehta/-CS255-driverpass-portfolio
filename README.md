CS 255 Portfolio Submission for DriverPass Project
This project was for DriverPass, a company that helps people get ready for their driving test. They wanted a system where students could sign up, book lessons, study online, and check their progress. The staff also needed tools to manage appointments, vehicles, and accounts. In Project One, I worked on the business requirements to understand what the client needed. In Project Two, I turned that into a design with diagrams and technical details.
One thing I think I did well was clearly organizing what each user (like student, admin, or staff) can do in the system. That helped me make sure the right people had the right access. If I had to go back and improve something, I would probably work on the activity diagram to show the steps more clearly.
When I was designing the system, I kept thinking about what people would expect when they use it. I wanted it to be intuitive and not cluttered. If somethingâ€™s hard to use, most people just give up. Next time, I would like to sketch some ideas first and maybe ask someone what they think before I finish the design. Lucidchart made it easier to lay things out clearly.
